Lecture One

bit - binary digit is the origin of the term bit
bit is a zero and one
bit is similary to a lightbulb being off as 0 and on as 1
byte is 8 bits - maximum is 265 - 3byes - 24bits
transistors represent this binarary switch
base2 - binary
base10 - decimal
unicode is the solution to ascii, add more bits 
32 bits is over a billion characters

Lecture Two
make also compiles
clang is a comiler
clang creates files in c -- clang -o hello hello.c
compiles a file called hello from the hello.c file
